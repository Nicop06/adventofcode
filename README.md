# Advent of code

This repository contains my solutions for the [advent of code
challenges](https://adventofcode.com). They are written in Haskell.

To run the solution for `dayX`, you can run `stack run dayX`.

You can also specify multiple days, e.g. `stack run 1 3 {8..10}` to run days 1,
3, 8, 9, 10 or `stack run {1..25}` to run all days.
