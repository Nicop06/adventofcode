# Advent of code

This repository contains my solutions for the [advent of code
challenges](https://adventofcode.com).

## 2022

In 2022, I decided to use Haskell. All the solutions use vanilla Haskell
libraries. To run the solution for `dayX` and `partY`, you can run:

```
runhaskell dayX partY
```

This should print the result.
