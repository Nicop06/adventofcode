# Advent of code

This repository contains my solutions for the [advent of code
challenges](https://adventofcode.com). They are written in Haskell.

To run the solution for `dayX`, you can run `stack run dayX`.

You can also specify multiple days, e.g. `stack run 1 3 {8..10}`.

If you want the solution for all the parts, simply do `stack run`.
